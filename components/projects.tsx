    This is the project from the 2nd semesterof my college. The project is to create a website for a fictional company called VKellogs, which is a cereal company that sells healthy and delicious cereals. The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a focus on the products and their benefits.

    From this project, I learned a lot about creating effective UI/UX designs. I also experienced the challenges of designing a website from scratch, and these challenges became valuable lessons to improve my skills for the future.`,
